## Keynote: Good Change, Bad Change

## Human Errors
#### Olivier Lacan

Context is useful before feedback

What is an error?
- state or condition of being wrong in conduct or judgement
- obsererved_value != true_value
- latin def is "wandering about"

Middle-users
- between the computers and end users

Can be better, as a community, about providing context with error messages

- Code survives by providing value and being difficult to replace

Kill and replace cells regularly
- easy to replace small components

Mutability of a system is enhanced by the immutability of its components

Accomplished with super simple interfaces.
